### Selected Scientific & Technical Models/Modules (Property of Environment Canada, Science & Technology Branch)

In addition to auto-generating file output directories and databases, all Python scripts are able to run directly through a standalone cmd prompt with a visual progress bar, time tracker and status updates. Generated outputs are usually in a colored visualization in a PDF report format, labeled and symbolized according to each chemical variable:
