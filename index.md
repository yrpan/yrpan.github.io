### Selected Scientific Support Models & Tools (2018-2020)


As a Scientific Support at Environment Canada from 2019- mid 2020, David produced a series of models and tools to support different scientific research initiatives, continued from his previous 2018 role as a Modeling Support Co-op Intern. In addition to auto-generating file output directories and databases, all Python script-based models and tools below are able to run directly through a standalone cmd prompt with a visual progress bar, time tracker and status updates. Generated outputs are usually in a colored visualization in a PDF report format, labeled and symbolized according to each chemical variable: 

- [Water Chemical Concentration – Averaging & Hotspot Toolset (programmed in Python), 2019 – 2020](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)
- [Water Sediment Fractions Prediction and Interpolation Toolset (programmed in Python), 2019 – 2020](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)
- [Water Sediment Thickness Prediction and Interpolation Toolset (programmed in Python), 2019 – 2020](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)
- [Water Sediment Data Plotting Toolset- Tracers, Heavy Metals, Soil Particles, Differences (programmed in Python), 2018 – 2019](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)
- [IDW & Kernel Water Quality Parameters Interpolation Toolset (programmed in Python), 2018](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)

Note*: These are the property of Environment Canada, Science & Technology Branch so I would not share the codes here
