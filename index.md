### Selected Scientific Support Models & Tools (2018-2020)


As a Scientific Support at Environment Canada from 2019- mid 2020, I produced a series of models and tools to support different scientific research initiatives, continued from my previous role as a Modeling Support Co-op Intern back in 2018. In addition to auto-generating file output directories and databases, all Python script-based models and tools are able to run directly through a standalone cmd prompt with a visual progress bar, time tracker and status updates. Generated outputs are usually in a colored visualization in a PDF report format, labeled and symbolized according to each chemical variable: 

- [IDW & Kernel Water Quality Parameters Interpolation Tool (2018)](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)
- [Sediment Thickness Prediction and Interpolation Models (2019-2020)](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)
- [Sediment Fractions Prediction and Interpolation Models (2019-2020)](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)
- [Sediment Data Plotting Tools - Tracers, Heavy Metals, Soil Particles, Differences (2018,2019)](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)
- [Chemical Concentration - Averaging & Hotspot Tool (2019-2020)](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)

Note*: These are the property of Environment Canada, Science & Technology Branch so I would not share the codes here
